### MetASM – Pedagogical Systems Development Environment
MetASM is a pedagogical development environment designed to help students
understand how high-level code affects machine-level behavior. It prioritizes
learning abstract systems concepts, such as control flow, memory, and execution,
through interactive code and visual constructs.

This project is being evaluated for inclusion as a micro-lab component in future
coursework at DeSales University, supporting instruction in systems and programming
related topics.

*(Individual project / Independent study - Compiler Design and Pedagogical Toolchain)*

- Paper: (link coming soon)
- Demo Video: (link coming soon)
