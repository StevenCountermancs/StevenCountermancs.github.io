### MetASM – Pedagogical Systems Development Environment
MetASM is a pedagogical development environment designed to help students
understand how high-level code affects machine-level behavior. It prioritizes
learning abstract systems concepts, such as control flow, memory, and execution,
through interactive code and visual constructs.
