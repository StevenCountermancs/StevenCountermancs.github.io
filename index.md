## About Me
I am a Computer Science student at DeSales University with a strong interest in
systems programming, software architecture, and visualization of abstract concepts
throughout the discipline. My academic work emphasizes building a deep understanding
of underlying systems rather than treating software as a black box.

Through coursework and independent study, I have developed projects in areas such as
compiler tooling, networking and security design, and backend application development.
I am particularly interested in creating education and developer-facing tools that make
complex system concepts more accessible and intuitive.
